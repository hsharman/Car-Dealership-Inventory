# Harry Sharman, Wade Bradford - Open Ended Project
# Car Dealership Inventory Program
In this Module 2 Open Ended Project, Harry and Wade created a main program and testing program for multiple classes. The parent class of car, and the child classes of Truck, SUV, Convertible, and offroadVehicle.
# Car Class
The car class is designed with the private fields of year, make, model, price, and mileage. Each field has the corresponding getters and setters.
# Child Classes (Truck, SUV, Convertible, offroadVehicle)
The child classes inherit from the Car parent class. Each child class adds additional fields specific to each kind of vehicle:
Truck - bedLength, towingCapacity, liftKit
SUV - peopleCarryingCapacity, trunkSize
Convertible - spoiler, convertibleTopLength, horsePower
offroadVehicle - groundClearance, winchAttached, tireSize
# Main Program

# Testing Program
The testing program is designed with methods for each class (car, truck, etc) that test the functions within each method. This mainly includes testing the getters and setters of each object to confirm that the functions work properly with each field.
