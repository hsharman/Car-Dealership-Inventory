# Harry Sharman - Open Ended Project
# Car Dealership Inventory Program
## Overview
This program prompts the user to enter a vehicle's year, make, model, price, and the vehicle type, and adds that data to a vector.
The user can enter more than one vehicle. The program will then print out the car dealerships inventory (all of the data that has been entered by the user)
organized by car 1, 2, 3.... 

## Concepts used
### Enumerated type:
The enumerated type is used for each of the different vehicle types, e.g. Hatchback, Saloon, etc....

### Struct:
The struct is used for characteristics of each vehicle, e.g. Year, Make, Model, etc....

### cin, getLine()

## Known bugs:
As can be seen in my video demo, when entering the model of the vehicle, the prompt isn't aligned correctly.

In the instructions, the user is told to press enter to quit the program. I still need to add this feature. 

## Future work:
I would like to add the car inventory to a .csv file, and allow for an existing .csv file to be loaded in and updated with new vehicles. 
At the moment, when the user decides to quit the 

## Citations:
Learned about std::numeric_limits for integer validation from:

## Grade:
### Main
I believe that my main function is fairly complex and uses conecpts from module 1, and is interactive with input validation.

I'd give myself 30 points because it's not terribly complex and some input isn't validated (strings).

### Concept: C++ class
I used two .cpp files (main.cpp and car.cpp) as well as a .h file (car.h).
I think it is designed well and makes sense.

I'd give myself 20 points for this.

### Concepts: Overloaded Operator, enum, struct
I unfortunately didn't overload an operator, but I did use an enum and struct

For this I'd give myself 4 points

### Style and documentation
I believe I have robust comments and documentation and my program is organized well. Classes are separated. 

I'd give myself the Default 0pts

### Video
I did multiple demo runs and demonstrated input validation
